Hello, fellow developers!
I'm an old retired programmer in the "real-time" industry.
Yes, that meant drivers in Windows NT and Intel 8080, anyone remember those?
Mostly in C, C++ and of course, Assembly and even machine-code!

These days I play in Java, Python, you know those fun stuff.
I mostly write code for family use and mental exercise to keep the neurons firing.
Glad to find this community where I am constantly amazed at the high quality
of folks and their work. And I am grateful!
